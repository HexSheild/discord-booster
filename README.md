Discord Server Booster
This tool is designed to automatically boost a Discord server using a bot account.

To get started, you‚Äôll need a few things configured properly. Follow the steps below to make sure everything is set up correctly.

üîß Setup Instructions
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open the token.txt file and paste your Discord token inside it.

This token must be from a valid bot or user account (use at your own risk).

Open the config.py file and fill in the required values:

token: Your Discord token (same as in token.txt)

server_id: The ID of the server you want to boost

client_id: Your application's client ID

client_secret: Your application's client secret

Save the files after editing.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Make sure the token you're using has the required permissions.

Boosting using a self-bot or user token may violate Discord‚Äôs Terms of Service.

Use this tool responsibly and only on servers you own or have permission to manage.

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
Simply run the main script using Python:


<pre> ```bash python main.py ``` </pre>
The tool will handle the boosting process automatically based on your config.
